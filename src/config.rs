//! # Global runtime configuration.
//!
//! Provides [`Config`] â€” centralized settings for the supervisor runtime.
//!
//! Config is used in two ways:
//! 1. **Supervisor creation**: `Supervisor::new(config, subscribers)`
//! 2. **TaskSpec defaults**: `TaskSpec::with_defaults(task, &config)`

/// Global configuration for the supervisor runtime.
///
/// Defines:
/// - **Shutdown behavior**: grace period for graceful termination
/// - **Concurrency limits**: max simultaneous tasks
/// - **Event system**: bus capacity for event delivery
/// - **Task defaults**: restart policy, backoff strategy, timeout
///
/// ## Field semantics
/// - `grace`: Maximum wait for tasks to stop gracefully (0 = no wait, force immediately)
/// - `max_concurrent`: Task concurrency limit (0 = unlimited)
/// - `bus_capacity`: Event bus ring buffer size (min 1, enforced by Bus)
/// - `timeout`: Default per-task timeout (0 = no timeout)
/// - `restart`: Default restart policy (can be overridden per-task)
/// - `backoff`: Default backoff strategy (can be overridden per-task)
///
/// ## Notes
/// All fields are public for flexibility. Ensure:
/// - `grace > Duration::ZERO` for graceful shutdown (0 = force kill)
/// - `bus_capacity >= 1` (enforced by Bus constructor)
/// - `timeout = Duration::ZERO` means no timeout (checked at runtime)
