//! # Runtime core.
//!
//! This module contains the taskvisor runtime implementation.

//! |--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
//! | `supervisor.rs`    | Public facade and composition root        |
//! | `handle.rs`        | Dynamic task management API               |
//! | `config.rs`        | Runtime defaults and limits               |
//! | `task_defaults.rs` | Default task execution settings           |

//! Internal runtime:
//!
//! | File / directory        | Role                                                   |

//! | `runtime.rs`, `runtime/`   | Composition, management, events, lifecycle, shutdown |
//! | `registry.rs`, `registry/` | Membership, admission, joins, removal, listener       |
//! | `actor.rs`                  | Runs one task with restart/backoff policy             |
//! | `runner.rs`                 | Executes one task attempt                             |

//! | `shutdown.rs`               | OS signal handling                                    |
//! | `panic_guard.rs`            | Panic boundary for long-lived listeners               |
//!
//! ## Planes
//!
//! taskvisor has three important runtime planes:
//!
//! ```text
//! Management plane:
//!   SupervisorHandle ──► SupervisorCore ──mpsc──► Registry
//!
//! Event plane:
//!   runtime components ──broadcast──► subscriber_listener ──► Subscribe impls
//!
//! Completion plane:
//!   Registry ──oneshot outcome──► TaskWaiter
//!            └─shared terminal──► cancel callers / controller slots
//!   SupervisorCore ──shared result──► shutdown callers
//! ```
//!
//! The management plane uses an mpsc command channel. Add, remove, and cancel commands are not delivered through the lossy event bus.
//! The event plane is best-effort and used for logs, metrics, snapshots, and subscriber integrations. Slow consumers can lag and miss events.
//! The completion plane provides watched task outcomes, terminal registry cleanup for cancellation
//! and controller slots, and one cached shutdown result.
//!
//! ## Main Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! Supervisor::run(tasks)
//!   ├─ start subscriber listener
//!   ├─ start registry listener
//!   ├─ send one initial AddBatch command
//!   ├─ wait for the direct registry decision
//!   └─ wait for OS shutdown signal or natural completion
//!
//! Supervisor::serve()
//!   ├─ start listeners
//!   └─ return SupervisorHandle
//! ```
//!
//! ## Events
//!
//! Events are published by:
//!
//! - `SupervisorCore`: add/remove/shutdown requests and final runtime verdicts.
//! - `TaskActor`: attempt starts, retry scheduling, actor terminal state.
//! - `SubscriberSet`: subscriber overflow and panic diagnostics.
//! - `Registry`: task added/removed confirmations.
//! - `runner`: per-attempt result events.
//!
//! `AllStoppedWithinGrace` can be emitted after explicit shutdown or after natural completion when all cleanup joins finish within the grace period.
//!
//! ## Notes
//!
//! - `Supervisor::run` is single-shot for one supervisor instance.
//! - Attempts within one `TaskActor` are sequential; the same actor never runs two attempts in parallel.
//! - Event sequence numbers are useful for stale-event filtering and sorting, but they are not a causal ordering guarantee across concurrent producers.
//! - A panic in a long-lived listener is caught and reported as a diagnostic event instead of silently killing the control loop.
