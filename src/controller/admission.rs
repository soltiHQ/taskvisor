//! # Per-task admission policy
//!
//! Controller treats tasks as **slots** identified by `name`.
//! At any given time **one** task may run in a slot.
//! When a new request for the same slot arrives, the admission policy decides what to do.
//!
//! ## Variants
//! - `DropIfRunning`: If the slot is already running, **ignore** the new request.
//! - `Replace`: **Stop** the running task (cancel/remove) and start the new one.
//! - `Queue`: **Enqueue** the new request (FIFO).
//!
//! ## Invariants
//! - Tasks within the same slot never run in parallel (use dynamic names if you need parallel execution).
//! - Queued requests are executed strictly in submission order.

/// Policy controlling how new submissions are handled when a slot is busy.
